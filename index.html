            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <b>Amy:</b> Okay, well. I've been planning this wedding for the last six months. And if you told me yesterday everything that was gonna go wrong, I would have had a panic attack that sent me into the ER. But I'm here, and I've never been happier. Life is unpredictable. Not everything's in our control. But as long as you're with the right people, you can handle anything. And you, Jake Peralta, are the right person for me. But I do have some bad news. There is a bomb at this wedding as well. <br><br><br>
                <b>Jake:</b> What? <br><br><br>
                <b>Amy:</b> Your butt. Your butt is the bomb. There will be no survivors.<br><br><br>
